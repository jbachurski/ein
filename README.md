# Ein

Ein is a _pointful array language_ embedded in Python. It is compiled into efficient _point-free_ whole-array operations as present in libraries like NumPy.

The `ein` library forms Ein's frontend in Python, with a lean API focused on array comprehensions constructed via the `array` function. It has NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX backends, and can thus be integrated with existing code.
